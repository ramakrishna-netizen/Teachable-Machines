Here's a more comprehensive context including both the UI modifications and backend functionality requirements for the Teachable Machine application:

Teachable Machine - Full Stack Implementation Guide

Frontend Overview

The Teachable Machine is a web application that allows users to:

Create and manage classification classes

Upload image samples for each class

Train a machine learning model based on these samples

Export the trained model for use in other applications

UI Components

We modified a Teachable Machine interface by replacing the menu-dots icon with a delete icon for class management.

Key UI components include:

Class cards with edit and delete functionality

Upload buttons for adding image samples

Class addition mechanism via "Add a class" button

Training section with a train button and advanced settings

Export section for trained models

Backend Functionality Requirements

1. Class Management API

POST /api/classes - Create a new class
GET /api/classes - List all classes
PUT /api/classes/{id} - Update class name
DELETE /api/classes/{id} - Delete class and its samples


2. Sample Management API

POST /api/classes/{id}/samples - Upload new samples
GET /api/classes/{id}/samples - Get samples for a class
DELETE /api/classes/{id}/samples/{sampleId} - Delete a sample


3. Model Training API

POST /api/train - Start model training process
GET /api/train/status - Check training status
GET /api/train/results - Get training results


4. Model Export API

GET /api/export - Get the trained model in required format
POST /api/export/settings - Configure export settings


Data Models

Class

{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "createdAt": "datetime",
  "updatedAt": "datetime",
  "sampleCount": "integer"
}


Sample

{
  "id": "string",
  "classId": "string",
  "fileUrl": "string",
  "thumbnailUrl": "string",
  "createdAt": "datetime",
  "metadata": "object"
}


TrainingJob

{
  "id": "string",
  "status": "enum(pending, training, completed, failed)",
  "progress": "float",
  "startedAt": "datetime",
  "completedAt": "datetime",
  "accuracy": "float",
  "settings": "object"
}


Technical Implementation Notes

Frontend

HTML/CSS/JavaScript application

Uses SVG for icons

Animation effects for dynamic elements

No external frontend framework used (could be enhanced with React/Vue)

Backend Requirements

RESTful API architecture

Image processing capabilities

Machine learning model training functionality

Authentication & authorization system

Database for class/sample storage

File storage for images and trained models

Machine Learning Integration

TensorFlow.js or TensorFlow backend

Transfer learning capabilities

Image classification model architecture

Model export functionality (TF.js, TFLite, etc.)

Deployment Considerations

Database selection (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

Image storage solution (S3, GCS)

Model training infrastructure (CPU/GPU requirements)

Scalability for multiple users

Security for user data protection

This comprehensive context provides both the UI aspects we've already modified and outlines the backend functionality that would be needed to complete the application. You can use this as a roadmap for implementing the complete system in the future.
